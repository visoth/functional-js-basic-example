This projet is a simple example of a basic app that fetch, process and show a list of random users grouped by city. It is here to illustrate the difference between imperative and functional programming.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS

## How to use it

To start the project, simply run this commande:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

To switch from imperative to functional, you can open the App.js file and replace the `fetchUsersImperative` import by `fetchUsersFunctional`.
